# node-red-contrib-twc-weather
Node-RED nodes for The Weather Company and Weather Underground Personal Weather Station APIs

These nodes replace the depreciated **node-red-node-weather-underground** with new TWC apis for querying [wunderground.com](https://wunderground.com) Personal Weather Station (PWS) data.

The set of nodes in this package implement the [APIs for Personal Weather Station Contributors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eKCnKXI9xnoMGRRzOL1xPCBihNV2rOet08qpE_gArAY).

## Install

Either use the Editor - Menu - Manage Palette - Install option, or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically `~/.node-red`).
```
$ npm install node-red-contrib-twc-weather
```

## Usage

Register your Personal Weather Station at [wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/member/devices) and copy your PWS Station ID and API Key into these Node-RED nodes.

## node-red-contrib-twc-weather Nodes

This Node-RED package creates six nodes in your Node-RED palette.
- **pws observations** - Personal Weather Station (PWS) Current Conditions returns the current conditions observations.
- **pws historical** - Personal Weather Station (PWS) Historical Data returns the historical PWS data for a single date ( hourly data, summary data for the entire day, or all records )
- **pws forecast** - The Daily Forecast API is sourced from the The Weather Company Forecast system. This TWC API returns the 5 Day Daily weather forecast.
- **pws 7 day summary** - Personal Weather Station (PWS) Daily Summary Historical Observations returns the 7 day summary of daily observations.
- **pws 7 day hourly** - Personal Weather Stations (PWS) Hourly Historical Observations returns the hourly records for each days observations report.
- **pws 1 day all** - Personal Weather Station (PWS) Rapid Historical Observations returns all of the observations records for a specific date.

## Examples

Two examples are provided in the [examples](/examples) folder.
